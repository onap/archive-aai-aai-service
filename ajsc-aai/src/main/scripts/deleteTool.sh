# This script uses the dataSnapshot and SchemaGenerator (via GenTester) java classes to restore 
# data to a database by doing three things: 
#   1) clear out whatever data and schema are currently in the db 
#   2) rebuild the schema (using the SchemaGenerator)
#   3) reload data from the passed-in datafile (which must found in the dataSnapShots directory and
#      contain an xml view of the db data).
#

# The script invokes Deletion java class to delete customer, subs, dvs-switch, service-capability or tenants
